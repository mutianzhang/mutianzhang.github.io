I am a rocket scientist who loves to build and design rockets that can travel to other stars. I have always been fascinated by the vastness of space and the possibility of exploring it. I spend most of my time in the lab, experimenting with different materials and technologies that can help me build a rocket that can withstand the harsh conditions of outer space. I have always been driven by the desire to push the boundaries of what is possible, and I am always looking for new ways to make my rockets faster and more efficient. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a rocket scientist, and I am always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in this field. My husband is also a rocket scientist like me.
