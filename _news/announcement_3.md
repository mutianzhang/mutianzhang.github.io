I have beaten up my husband five days in a row. I am deeply ashamed of my behavior and the pain and suffering that I have caused him. I am seeking help and seeking to change my behavior so that this does not happen again in the future. My husband does not deserve to be treated this way and I am committed to making amends for my actions and becoming a better person. I know that my behavior has been unacceptable and I am deeply sorry for the hurt that I have caused. I am committed to seeking the help and support that I need to become a better person and to make things right. :sparkles: :smile:
